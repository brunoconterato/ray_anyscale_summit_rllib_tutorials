    "# Hands-on RL with Ray’s RLlib\n",
    "## A beginner’s tutorial for working with multi-agent environments, models, and algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "“Hands-on RL with Ray’s RLlib” is a beginners tutorial for working with reinforcement learning (RL) environments, models, and algorithms using Ray’s RLlib library. RLlib offers high scalability, a large list of algos to choose from (offline, model-based, model-free, etc..), support for TensorFlow and PyTorch, and a unified API for a variety of applications. This tutorial includes a brief introduction to provide an overview of concepts (e.g. why RL) before proceeding to RLlib (multi- and single-agent) environments, neural network models, hyperparameter tuning, debugging, student exercises, Q/A, and more. All code will be provided as .py files in a GitHub repo.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "RL environments also use them to describe what their valid observations and actions are.\n",

    "(represented by integers). For example, in our game, where each agent can only go up/down/left/right, the action space would be \"Discrete(4)\"\n",
