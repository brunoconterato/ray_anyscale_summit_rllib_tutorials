    "### Overview\n",
    "“Reinforcement Learning for Recommender Systems, From Contextual Bandits to Slate-Q” is a tutorial for industry researchers, domain-experts, and ML-engineers, showcasing ...\n",
    "\n",
    "1) .. how you can use RLlib to build a recommender system **simulator** for your industry applications and run Bandit algorithms and the Slate-Q algorithm against this simulator.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) .. how RLlib's offline algorithms pose solutions in case you **don't have a simulator** of your problem environment at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will further explore how to deploy trained models to production using Ray Serve.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the live-coding phases, we will using a recommender system simulating environment by google's RecSim and configure and run 2 RLlib algorithms against it. We'll also demonstrate how you may use offline RL as a solution for recommender systems and how to deploy a learned policy into production.\n",
    "\n",
    "RLlib offers industry-grade scalability, a large list of algos to choose from (offline, model-based, model-free, etc..), support for TensorFlow and PyTorch, and a unified API for a variety of applications. This tutorial includes a brief introduction to provide an overview of concepts (e.g. why RL?) before proceeding to RLlib (recommender system) environments, neural network models, offline RL, student exercises, Q/A, and more. All code will be provided as .py files in a GitHub repo."
